    * **NOTE:** Make sure you are in the project directory created in Step 1. 
    * Use the following command to clone the **Senior-Project** repo: `clone https://github.com/ITM4900-Team-4-Senior-Project/Senior-Project.git`.
    * A new folder (**Senior-Project**) will be created in the current working directory (see the first bullet above).

## Project Workflow

As a way of tracking and retaining our code, there is a branch for each project member to work from. 

1. Run the following command within the **Senior Project** directory ( to switch to your branch: `git checkout [YOUR BRANCH NAME]`. 
    
2. Make sure whichever IDE you are using to for coding tasks is saving your work in the **Senior-Project** directory (this will differ between IDEs).
