    * **NOTE:** Make sure you are in the project directory created in Step 1.
    * Use the following command to clone the **Senior-Project** repo: `clone https://github.com/ITM4900-Team-4-Senior-Project/Senior-Project.git`.
    * A new folder (**Senior-Project**) will be created in the current working directory (see the first bullet above).

## Creating & Checking Out Branches

![Creating & Checking Out Branches Example](https://github.com/ITM4900-Team-4-Senior-Project/Senior-Project/blob/main/docs/create-checkout-branch.gif?raw=true)

As a way of tracking and retaining our code, create a branch for you work.

1. Run the following command within the **Senior Project** directory ( to switch to your branch: `git checkout -b [YOUR BRANCH NAME]`. The `-b` switch will create a new branch with the name you give it. If you already have a branch you can omit the `-b` switch.

2. Make sure whichever IDE you are using to for coding tasks is saving your work in the **Senior-Project** directory (this will differ between IDEs).
